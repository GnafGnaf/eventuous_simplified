#About
A lightweight Event Sourcing library for Dart, which is:

    Very volatile
    Extremely opinionated
    EventStoreDB-oriented

The .Net original is built by Alexey Zimarev and Kenneth Gulbrands√∏y built a Dart version.
The Dart version has some substential differences in the approches Kenneth took. 
Because of that the original .Net documentation is not applicable. Since the dart version lacks 
a documentation, it is very hard to use. This package aims to adress these issues.
Of course, there will be language related differences and it is important to me, that the 
code is understandable for dart developers.


The Documentation can be found in the documents directory. it is will get better.
